In the generation feature, the following uses are prohibited:

- From a legal standpoint, do not generate unmodified images (including representations of genitalia, genital connection areas, insertion areas, and anus connection or insertion areas, as well as parts that resemble genitalia, including depictions of lines).
- This applies to both illustrations and realistic images. Unmodified images are strictly prohibited.
- The use of multiple accounts for generation purposes is prohibited.
- Generating images that may be mistaken for child pornography is strictly prohibited. This includes any realistic style that depicts sexual content involving characters that appear to be under 18 years old.
- Generating images with realistic sexual content involving elements such as school uniforms or backgrounds set in a school, which could be suspected of being child pornography, is also prohibited.
- Sexual content includes depictions of swimwear, revealing clothing, erotic poses, semen, and similar elements.
- Please ensure that your prompts are written to prevent the generation of content that violates the above restrictions. If you are concerned about generating inappropriate sexual content, we recommend using illustration-style models.
- All generated results, including those manually deleted, are reviewed. If inappropriate use is detected, your access to the generation feature may be revoked.
